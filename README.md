Biomedical Data Set Binary Classification, built by Dr. Henrique de Mota in Lyon,France.

6 biomechanical attributes of the spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and grade of spondylolisthesis.

Based on the measurements of these 6 attributes for 480 observations, a person is classified as Abnormal (AB) - which includes Disk Hernia (DH) and Spondylolisthesis (SL), or Normal (NO).
