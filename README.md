Biomedical Data Set Binary Classification, built by Dr. Henrique de Mota in Lyon,France.

480 instances, 6 attributes: Abnormal or Normal

6 biomechanical attributes derived from the spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and grade of spondylolisthesis.

Based on these 6 biomechanical attributes, a person is classified as Abnormal - either having a Disk Hernia or Spondylolisthesis, or Normal.
